                <h2>A Third Way on AI</h2>
                <p>Last week was an important moment in the debate about AI, with President Biden issuing an executive
                    order and the UK’s AI Safety Summit convening world leaders.

                    Much of the buzz around these events made it sound like AI presents us with a binary choice:
                    unbridled optimism, or existential fear. But there was also a third path available, a nuanced,
                    practical perspective that examines the real risks and benefits of AI. </p>

            <h2>Tech Trends 2024: AI and electric vehicle deals</h2>
            <p>In the tech world, 2023 will perhaps be remembered as the year that generative AI went mainstream.

                From computer code, to artwork, to essays, generative AI systems can quickly create a range of content
                which, while not perfect, has become an essential tool in some industries and professions.

                Backed by Microsoft, ChatGPT led the way with its launch in late 2022, and rivals have been piling in
                ever since.</p>
            <p>
                This month brought one of the most significant moves, when Alphabet, the owner of Google, revealed
                Gemini - an AI which will be integrated into Google products, including its chatbot and search engine.

                Alphabet claims Gemini outperforms the current version of ChatGPT.

                But the creator of ChatGPT, OpenAI, says it is not standing still. It is promising a more powerful
                version of its software next year.

                        Humanoid robots could start to look more useful next year. At Tesla engineers are working on
                        Optimus - a humanoid robot that they hope will soon be doing basic factory jobs.

                        A video released earlier this month showed the latest version of Optimus - lighter than the
                        previous machine, with new hands and powered by new motors.

            <h2>AI development expected to 'explode' in 2024, experts say</h2>
            <p>Artificial intelligence made a big splash with consumers and regulators alike in 2023, with experts
                believing the continued development of the technology will reach even greater heights in 2024.

                "I think that in 2024, AI will move a little closer to what is in the public imagination, but we remain
                years from AI being autonomous in the way people are imagining it," Christopher Alexander, chief
                analytics officer of Pioneer Development Group, told Fox News Digital.

                Alexander's comments come after 2023 saw a noticeable leap in the development and availability of AI
                tools, with popular language learning model (LLM) platforms such as OpenAI's ChatGPT gaining huge
                popularity and energizing other tech giants to come along for the ride.</p>
            <p>
                Microsoft was one of the first companies to follow the leader of OpenAI in 2023, announcing a large
                investment in the AI company while also launching its own chatbot that will be used on both its Bing
                search platform and another AI bot compatible with Windows 11. Google, Amazon and Meta also announced AI
                initiatives of their own early this year, setting up a new arms race among many of the tech giants.

                But the growing technology also has the potential to be a boom industry for startups, experts believe, a
                trend that could really begin to show in 2024.
